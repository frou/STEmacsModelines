This is my fork of [STEmacsModelines](https://github.com/kvs/STEmacsModelines) that I have modified to my own taste.

NOTE: The original package talks about, and is named after, "Modelines". As far as I can tell, this is a misnomer, because the concept we're actually dealing with here is [File Variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html), whereas Modelines are a [UI thing](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Mode-Line.html).
